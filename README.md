A simple library to get flight data from flightradar24 from within Python code.

Please note that this is not an offical API and does not use any (semi-)official API from flightradar24.
This code simply automates what you would do from a browser and extracts the flight history by aircraft registration or by the flight number, and other details in a similar fashion 

We depend on the structure of the pages, so if the pages change, then this API will need to be updated. There is no defined plan to look out for these changes and keep the API updated. So do not use this in mission critical applications.

The idea is to use this in cases where you want to exatract flight information for analysis, in a reasonable manner without bombarding the site with lot of requests and without having to manually do the recording of data by hand. Or when you have an application were you would like to give the user the ability to search from flight information and see within the app

The API does not provide any mass request mechanism and does not recommend such usage or take responsibility for any such usage by anyone.

Eventually we will add more sites and more information to the API.


IPython notebook example
========================

Here are a few basic examples

http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/supercoderz/pyflightdata/blob/master/pyflightdata%20examples.ipynb

Installation and Usage
======================

You can install with ``pip``

    pip install pyflightdata

You need to instantiate the API first. You have the option of passing in your flightradar24 credentials in the form of email and password.
If you dont pass in the credentials then it will invoke the API without the authorization key.

    from pyflightdata import FlightData
    api=FlightData()

In case you want to use your flightradar24 user ID, then you can pass in the credentials to FlightData

    api=FlightData(user_email,password)

    api.login(user_email,password)

    api.logout()

Using your credentials will allow you to get more data as per your plan with flighradar24

Usage is very simple. To get the list of all countries with airports use ``get_countries``

    api.get_countries()
	
To get list of all airports and the airport codes in a given country use ``get_airports``

    api.get_airports('India')

Once you have the airport details, you can use the iata code from the results and call one of the many ``get_airport_*`` methods. These provide information like the airport details, weather, reviews and also the arrival/departure/on ground information.

    api.get_airport_arrivals('SIN')
    api.get_airport_departures('SIN')
	
This will return a list of (name,code) tuples.

To get information on a particular aircraft, use ``get_info_by_tail_number``

    api.get_info_by_tail_number('VT-ALL')
	
This will return a dict.

To get flight history, you can use tail number or flight number. Both will return a list of dicts with the details of date of flight, from and to, tail number or flight, status and arrival departure times. The commands are

    api.get_history_by_flight_number('AI101')
	
or

    api.get_history_by_tail_number('VT-ALL')

The above two methods also allow you to specify the page number and the limit as well. The default is page number 1 and limit 100, the maximum limit. If you have a paid member account and want to get more than 100 records, then you need to keep increasing the page number. At the moment there is no way to know how many pages are there. The limit parameter has a max value of 100 and is used to control the number of elements retrieved on a page.

    api.get_history_by_tail_number('VT-ALL',1,100)
	
There are methods that you can use to get the list of all the airlines, their fleet list and list of all flight numbers

    api.get_airlines()
	
This returns a list of dicts. Each airline dict has a field called 'key' which can be used to get the fleet and flight numbers

    api.get_fleet('air-india-aic')
	
    api.get_flights('air-india-aic')
